# CleanroomBase

CleanroomBase contains low-level utilities useful for developing Swift-based iOS applications.

At Gilt, we use CleanroomBase as foundation of our next-generation iOS application, which is currently in development.

CleanroomBase is part of [the Cleanroom Project](http://github.com/gilt/Cleanroom) from [Gilt Tech](http://tech.gilt.com) and is distributed under [the MIT license](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger/blob/master/LICENSE).

Then, all you will need to do is add the following `import` statement to any Swift file where you want to use CleanroomBase:
